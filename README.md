# Movies_Recommendation_System
In this project, we have developed a Movie Recommendation System using the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. The dataset contains information about a large number of movies, including details like title, genre, cast, crew, and user ratings. Our goal is to build a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences.
