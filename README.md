# Movies_Recommendation_System
In this project, we have developed a Movie Recommendation System using the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. The dataset contains information about a large number of movies, including details like title, genre, cast, crew, and user ratings. Our goal is to build a recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences.

Objective Statement:
Developed a movie recommendation system leveraging machine learning techniques and the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset to provide personalized movie suggestions to users.

Key Technologies and Tools:
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Project Description:
Implemented a content-based and collaborative filtering movie recommendation system using Python and machine learning libraries.
Processed and cleaned the TMDB dataset, handling missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical representations.
Utilized content-based filtering to recommend movies based on user preferences and movie characteristics, including descriptions and genres.
Incorporated collaborative filtering to enhance recommendations by considering user behavior and preferences.
Developed an interactive user interface using Streamlit, allowing users to input preferences and receive dynamically generated movie suggestions.
Conducted evaluation and optimization of the recommendation system, achieving high accuracy and user satisfaction.
Deployed the system, making personalized movie recommendations accessible to users through a web interface.
